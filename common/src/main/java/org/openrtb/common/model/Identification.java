/**
 * Verification of the message content is handled inline with each request.
 * Every request contains an identification object. The identifier's token is
 * constructed by computing the MD5 checksum of the JSON request message, less
 * the token attribute, concatenated with a shared secret. The receiver of the
 * request must remove the token from the request and generate an MD5 checksum
 * with the same shared secret to confirm the message contents.
 *
 * The shared secret may take any form (i.e. text string or key encryption) and
 * is communicated between the parties outside of this protocol.
 *
 * This object encapsulates the <code>identification</code> object found in the
 * requests and responses between a DSP and SSP.
